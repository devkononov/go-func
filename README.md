## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://#) on the wiki.

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.10 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```
